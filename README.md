# SmartContracts

This repo is a collection of smart contracts that I wrote for learning purposes:
- Crowdfunding contract written in Solidity, more [here](https://github.com/mikiw/SmartContracts/tree/main/crowdfunding/solidity%200.8.17)
- Crowdfunding contract written in Cairo, more [here](https://github.com/mikiw/SmartContracts/tree/main/crowdfunding/cairo%200.10.1)
- Fact registry Solana contract written in Rust, more [here](https://github.com/mikiw/SmartContracts/tree/main/zk-proof-fact-registry/solana/)
